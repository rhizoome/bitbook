This multi-band stereo imager is designed to process audio by splitting the
frequency spectrum into distinct bands (low, mid, and high) using Bitwig’s
Crossover-3 device. Once divided, each band’s stereo width — the perceived
spatial distance of panned sound sources — can be adjusted individually. After
these adjustments, the bands are seamlessly recombined.

Crossover filters are specially designed to recombine without overlap or phase
changes.
